# Citation Portfolio Page 

**Title**: Citation Portfolio <br>
**Date**: 29 Jan 2022 <br>
**Deliverable**: CSS/HTML Webpage <br>


For week 1, I learnt how to create a static webpage using HTML and CSS. For this week's assignment, I created a portfolio page for my most recent game prdouction project Citation. For the summer of 2021, I interned at Hall Pass Studios. I worked on a project Citation - an interactive game that supports NYU students to learn academic integrity concepts. For this project, I made a webpage portfolio based on the pdf version of portfolio I created on Figma.
